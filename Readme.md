# Week15A

Our Week-15A tasks at CodeCool were about 4 C#-related topics:
* Serialization
* Regular Expressions
* a bit of File-Encoding
* Multithreading

You can find some task-description here:
* [Regular Expressions and File-Encoding](descRegexp.md)
* [Serialization](descSerializing.md)
* [Multithreading](descThreading.md)

As we got 4 topics, my solution contains 4 projects:
* [Serializing](Serialiying/) (Serialization)
* [InputValidating](InputValidating/) (Regular Expressions)
* [EncodingDemo](EncodingDemo/) (FIle-Encoding)
* [SimpleThreadingDemo](SimpleThreadiDemo/) (Multithreading)
