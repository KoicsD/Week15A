# Week15A

Our Week-15A tasks at CodeCool were about 4 C#-related topics:
* Serialization
* Regular Expressions
* a bit of File-Encoding
* Multithreading

You can find some task-description here:
* [Regular Expressions and File-Encoding](descRegexp.md)
* [Serialization](descSerializing.md)
* [Multithreading](descThreading.md)

As we got 4 topics, my solution contains the following projects:
* Regular Expressions and File-Encoding:
	* [InputValidating](InputValidating/)
	* [EncodingDemo](EncodingDemo/)
* Serialization:
	* [Serializing](Serialiying/)
* Multithreading:
	* [SimpleThreadingDemo](SimpleThreadingDemo/)
	* [SingleInstanceExample](SingleInstanceExample/)
