## Objectives of the week

This week you will learn about threading, serialization and special string operations.

A **thread** is defined as the execution path of a program.
Each thread defines a unique flow of control.
If your application involves complicated and time consuming operations,
then it is often helpful to set different execution paths or threads, with each thread performing a particular job.

Threads are **lightweight** processes.
One common example of use of thread is implementation of concurrent programming by modern operating systems.
Use of threads saves wastage of CPU cycle and increase efficiency of an application.

So far we wrote the programs where a single thread runs as a single process which is the running instance of the application.
However, this way the application can perform one job at a time.
To make it execute more than one task at a time, it could be divided into smaller threads.

### String operations

A **regular expression** is a pattern that could be matched against an input text.
The .Net framework provides a regular expression engine that allows such matching.
A pattern consists of one or more character literals, operators, or constructs.
